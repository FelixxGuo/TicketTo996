Backtracking Algorithm
	Definition: A search strategy that uses try + undo to solve problems
        such as combinations, permutations, subsets, and paths.
	Core Idea:
		Make a decision (e.g., choose which step to take or which number to select).
		Recursively proceed to the next step.
		If the current path is invalid or the search is complete, undo the choice (backtrack).
	Characteristics: DFS + conditional checks + undoing actions
 Code   
    function backtrack(path):
        if path meets goal:
            save solution
            return
        for option in choices:
            make choice
            backtrack(path)
            undo choice
